## 📘 README — *The Tale of the PLP Basic Calculator*

Once upon a line of code, I, a budding programmer on my Power Learn Project journey, decided to bring a little math magic to life. 
I created something simple, yet powerful — the **PLP BASIC CALCULATOR ASSIGNMENT**.

The story begins with a cheerful greeting:

```python
print('PLP BASIC CALCULATOR ASSIGNMENT')
```

It proudly announces its purpose, setting the tone for what’s to come.

Next, like a polite assistant, the calculator asks the user:

> “Please enter the first number.”
> It stores this value quietly, waiting for the next instruction.

Then comes the twist:

> “What operation would you like to perform? +, -, \*, or /?”
> The user picks a symbol — the calculator listens carefully.

Finally, it asks:

> “And the second number, please?”
> With both numbers and the chosen operation, the calculator prepares for action.

Now the logic unfolds like a chaptered book:

* If the user chose **+**, it adds the numbers and displays the answer.
* If the choice was **-**, it subtracts the second number from the first.
* If **\***, it multiplies them with energy.
* If **/**, it divides the numbers and returns a precise result using decimals.

Each possible operation is wrapped in an `if` or `elif` block — the decision-makers of this tiny digital hero.

There are no fancy interfaces or complicated algorithms — just a simple, clear script that does what it promises: **calculate.**

And in doing so, it becomes more than just a few lines of code — it becomes a programmer’s first step into logic, decision-making, and user interaction.
